    "content = 'Ah, diving into the world of integration, I see! No sweat, I\\'ll guide you through it step by step. Think of integration as the reverse process of differentiation. It\\'s like figuring out the original function when you only know its derivative.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s break down the integral:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int 2x \\\\cos(x^2 - 5) \\\\, dx\\n\\\\]\\n1. **Recognize the Pattern**:\\n   - Notice that \\\\(2x\\\\) is the derivative of \\\\(x^2 - 5\\\\). This suggests we can use substitution.\\n\\n2. **Apply u-Substitution**:\\n   - Let \\\\(u = x^2 - 5\\\\).\\n   - Then, \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dx} = 2x\\\\), which means \\\\(du = 2x \\\\, dx\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Substitute**:\\n   - Replace \\\\(x^2 - 5\\\\) with \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(2x \\\\, dx\\\\) with \\\\(du\\\\) in the integral:\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\int \\\\cos(u) \\\\, du\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n4. **Integrate**:\\n   - The integral of \\\\(\\\\cos(u)\\\\) with respect to \\\\(u\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\sin(u)\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\int \\\\cos(u) \\\\, du = \\\\sin(u) + C\\n     \\\\]\\n     where \\\\(C\\\\) is the constant of integration.\\n\\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\\n   - Replace \\\\(u\\\\) with \\\\(x^2 - 5\\\\) to get the final answer:\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\sin(x^2 - 5) + C\\n     \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the final answer is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int 2x \\\\cos(x^2 - 5) \\\\, dx = \\\\sin(x^2 - 5) + C\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Concept and Explanation:\\n\\n#### What is Integration?\\nIntegration is a way to find the area under a curve. Imagine you have a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and you want to find the area between the curve of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and the x-axis over an interval \\\\([a, b]\\\\). Integration helps you find that area.\\n\\n#### Why u-Substitution?\\nU-substitution (also known as variable substitution) is a technique used to simplify integrals when you have a composite function. It\\'s like peeling an onion layer by layer. In this case, we had \\\\(\\\\cos(x^2 - 5)\\\\), and we simplified it by letting \\\\(u = x^2 - 5\\\\).\\n\\n#### Constant of Integration (C)\\nDon\\'t forget the \"+ C\"! When you find an indefinite integral, you\\'re finding a family of functions that all have the same derivative. The constant \\\\(C\\\\) represents any possible constant term that would disappear when you take the derivative.\\n\\n### Example:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want to find:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int 3x^2 \\\\sin(x^3 + 7) \\\\, dx\\n\\\\]\\n1. **Let \\\\(u = x^3 + 7\\\\)**, so \\\\(du = 3x^2 \\\\, dx\\\\).\\n2. **Substitute**: \\\\(\\\\int \\\\sin(u) \\\\, du\\\\).\\n3. **Integrate**: \\\\(-\\\\cos(u) + C\\\\).\\n4. **Back-Substitute**: \\\\(-\\\\cos(x^3 + 7) + C\\\\).\\n\\n### Resources:\\n\\n1.  **Khan Academy**:\\n    -   [Khan Academy Integration](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals)\\n2.  **Paul\\'s Online Math Notes**:\\n    -   [Paul\\'s Online Math Notes - Integrals](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Integrals.aspx)\\n3.  **MIT OpenCourseWare**:\\n    -   [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions or want to try another problem! Happy integrating!'"
