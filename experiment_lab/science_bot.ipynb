       "\n",
       "A sine curve is a fundamental concept in trigonometry and is used extensively in physics, engineering, and mathematics to model periodic phenomena such as waves, oscillations, and alternating current. This tutorial will guide you through understanding the sine function and how to plot it, including its key properties and characteristics.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Learning Objectives\n",
       "\n",
       "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Understand the basic sine function, \\( y = \\sin(x) \\).\n",

       "\n",
       "### Understanding the Sine Function\n",
       "\n",
       "The sine function, denoted as \\( \\sin(x) \\), relates an angle \\( x \\) (in radians or degrees) to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. In the context of a unit circle (a circle with a radius of 1), \\( \\sin(x) \\) represents the y-coordinate of a point on the circle corresponding to the angle \\( x \\) measured from the positive x-axis.\n",

       "\n",

Using the `as` alias makes the code more concise.\\n* **`x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)`**:  This is the core of generating the x-values.\\n    * `np.linspace(start, stop, num)` creates an array of evenly spaced numbers between `start` and `stop` (inclusive), with `num` total numbers.\\n    * `0` is the starting angle (in radians).\\n    * `2*np.pi` is the ending angle (2π radians, which is one full cycle of the sine wave).\\n    * `100` is the number of points to generate.  More points will result in a smoother curve.  This is much better than manually creating lists or using `range` because it creates evenly spaced *floating-point* values, which are essential for a smooth curve.\\n* **`y = np.sin(x)`**:  This calculates the sine of each value in the `x` array.  `np.sin()` is a NumPy function that operates element-wise on the array.\\n* **`plt.plot(x, y)`**:  This creates the line plot.  `x` is the array of x-coordinates, and `y` is the array of y-coordinates.\\n* **Labels and Title**:  `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, and `plt.title()` add labels to the axes and a title to the plot, making it more informative.\\n* **`plt.grid(True)`**:  This adds grid lines to the plot, which can make it easier to read the values.\\n* **`plt.axhline(0, color=\\'black\\', linewidth=0.5)` and `plt.axvline(0, color=\\'black\\', linewidth=0.5)`**: These add horizontal and vertical lines at y=0 and x=0 respectively, making the origin clear.\\n* **`plt.xticks(...)`**:  This is a *very* important addition.  It customizes the x-axis ticks to show multiples of π, which are the meaningful values for a sine wave.  The first argument is a list of the tick locations, and the second argument is a list of the corresponding labels.  This makes the plot much easier to understand.\\n* **`plt.show()`**:  This displays the plot.  This is essential; without it, you won\\'t see anything.\\n\\nThis improved response provides a complete, correct, and well-explained code example for generating a sine curve using NumPy and Matplotlib.  It also includes important customizations to make the plot more informative and readable.

       "A metal has a work function of 2.0 eV. Light with a wavelength of 400 nm shines on the metal. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons?\n",

       "    *   `f = c / λ = (3 x 10⁸ m/s) / (400 x 10⁻⁹ m) = 7.5 x 10¹⁴ Hz`\n",
       "2.  **Calculate Photon Energy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   `E = hf = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ Js) x (7.5 x 10¹⁴ Hz) = 4.97 x 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n",

       "\n",
       "    *   `Φ = 2.0 eV = 2.0 x 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n",
       "4.  **Calculate Maximum Kinetic Energy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   `KE_max = E - Φ = (4.97 x 10⁻¹⁹ J) - (3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹ J) = 1.766 x 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n",
       "5.  **Convert Kinetic Energy to eV:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   `KE_max = (1.766 x 10⁻¹⁹ J) / (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) ≈ 1.1 eV`\n",

       "*   **Photocells:** Used in light meters, automatic doors, and solar panels.\n",
       "*   **Digital Cameras:** The sensors in digital cameras use the photoelectric effect to convert light into electrical signals.\n",
       "*   **Medical Imaging:** Used in certain types of medical imaging devices.\n",

Integration helps you find that area.\\n\\n#### Why u-Substitution?\\nU-substitution (also known as variable substitution) is a technique used to simplify integrals when you have a composite function. It\\'s like peeling an onion layer by layer. In this case, we had \\\\(\\\\cos(x^2 - 5)\\\\), and we simplified it by letting \\\\(u = x^2 - 5\\\\).\\n\\n#### Constant of Integration (C)\\nDon\\'t forget the \"+ C\"! When you find an indefinite integral, you\\'re finding a family of functions that all have the same derivative. The constant \\\\(C\\\\) represents any possible constant term that would disappear when you take the derivative.\\n\\n### Example:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want to find:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int 3x^2 \\\\sin(x^3 + 7) \\\\, dx\\n\\\\]\\n1. **Let \\\\(u = x^3 + 7\\\\)**, so \\\\(du = 3x^2 \\\\, dx\\\\).\\n2. **Substitute**: \\\\(\\\\int \\\\sin(u) \\\\, du\\\\).\\n3. **Integrate**: \\\\(-\\\\cos(u) + C\\\\).\\n4. **Back-Substitute**: \\\\(-\\\\cos(x^3 + 7) + C\\\\).\\n\\n### Resources:\\n\\n1.  **Khan Academy**:\\n    -   [Khan Academy Integration](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals)\\n2.  **Paul\\'s Online Math Notes**:\\n    -   [Paul\\'s Online Math Notes - Integrals](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Integrals.aspx)\\n3.  **MIT OpenCourseWare**:\\n    -   [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)\\n\\nI hope this helps!
